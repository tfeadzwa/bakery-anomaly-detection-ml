10. OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES & RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
💡 UNDERUTILIZED VEHICLES: 216 routes (<50% capacity)
   Action: Consolidate routes, downsize vehicles
   Impact: Reduce fuel costs, improve efficiency

⏰ LONG RURAL ROUTES: 19 routes (>3 hours)
   Action: Establish regional hubs, stagger dispatch
   Impact: Reduce freshness risk, improve delivery reliability

🏙️ HIGH-DENSITY URBAN ROUTES: 35 routes
   Action: Optimize stop sequencing, avoid peak traffic
   Impact: Reduce delays, improve on-time delivery

👤 DRIVER ASSIGNMENT GAPS: 1 unassigned routes
   Action: Assign backup drivers, cross-train
   Impact: Improve coverage, reduce delays

KEY RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. DELAY NORMALIZATION: Use estimated_time_min as baseline for anomaly detection
   normalized_delay = (actual - estimated) / estimated

2. ROUTE RISK SCORING: Integrate risk_score with dispatch/waste data
   High-risk routes should have priority monitoring

3. VEHICLE OPTIMIZATION: Match vehicle capacity to route demand
   Reduce overloading (damage) and underutilization (cost)

4. REGIONAL HUBS: For long rural routes, consider intermediate storage
   Reduces freshness degradation on 3+ hour routes

5. DRIVER PERFORMANCE: Link driver_id to dispatch outcomes
   Identify training needs, reward high performers
